## Description

A lottery game to test your risk taking behavior (single player)

## Summary of theoretical background and hypotheses
What we are basically interested in is the association of emotions and risk behavior. The question under research will be how specific emotions affect risk decisions in online environments.
The most famous theory of explaining decision making under uncertainty is the Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky 1979). The Prospect Theory (PT) constitutes an alternative to Expected Utility Theory, which models decision making of perfectly rational agents and states that choices are made with regards to their maximum utility. The starting point of PT, however, is the concept of loss aversion, stating that people have a tendency to weigh losses more heavily than gains (e.g. gaining 100$ has a lower psychological value than losing 100$). Another feature of PT is the assumption that people are not either risk-averse or risk-seeking, but rather that they can be both: risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses. One implication of prospect theory thus is that risky decisions are driven by framing effects.
Literature shows that emotions have an additional effect on decision making. Vampos-Vazquez and Cuilty (2014), by performing experiments in school classes, were able to show that sadness increases risk aversion (in gain frame) and that anger increases decreases loss aversion and thus triggers risk-loving behavior. Kugler et al. (2012) found results for feelings of fear, where people became more risk averse. They also found anger to be negatively influencing risk aversion. Baumann and DeSteno (2012) corroborate these findings, by finding that anger increases risky choices.
From literature we derive the following hypotheses:
Assumption: People in the control condition (no emotional framing) are risk averse (in win frame) (% of people deciding risk-averse -> baseline)
H1: Framing participants on sadness increases their risk aversion
H2: Framing participants on anger increases their risk affinity
H3: Framing participants on fear increases their risk aversion
Experimental design

## Participants and Procedures

The main purpose of this study is to gauge participantâ€™s risk seeking and risk averse behavior. The participants in this study are students from the University of Mannheim in Germany.  The students are able to complete the experiment from any location in their own time. When participants click the button to start the game, they are first asked to indicate their sociodemographic background, such as, age, sex, and highest education level. They are then directed to the mood assessment survey where they indicate how they are feeling at the moment. Participants will take a fake questionnaire to divert their attention from the main purpose of the study. After completing the fake questionnaire, they will complete the writing task, mood assessment 2, and lottery game. 

## Writing Task

The participants complete a writing task within the allocated 30 minute time frame. Participants will be asked to write about their own experiences where they felt angry, sad, scared.

## Game

We are still discussing what type of game to use (i.e., lottery game). At the moment we will use the Risk widget. 

## Feedback & Informed Consent

We will create a feedback and text and a section for participants to give their consent.
