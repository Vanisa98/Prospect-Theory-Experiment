      Thank you for participating in our study!
      <br><br>
      With this short debriefing we want to inform you about the goal of our study and why you had to answer these questions.
	  <br><br>
      Follow-up research on the Prospect Theory by Kahnemann and Tversky suggests that there is a linkage between emotions and risk-taking behaviour.
	  This experiment aimed on contributing to this research by putting you in a certain emotional state and test your risk aversion afterwards. To be more
	  precise we have 3 hypotheses:
      <br><br>
      H1: Putting participants in a sad emotional state increases their risk aversion <br>
	  H2: Putting participants in an angry emotional state increases their risk affinity <br>
	  H3: Putting participants in a fearful emotional state increases their risk aversion
      <br><br>
	  To observe the effects we are interested in, it was unfortunately necessary to manipulate your emotional state for a short amount of time.
	  We put you in the certain emomtional state by letting you complete the writing task where you had to report from a emotional situation in your life. You were randomnly assigned to one of the emotional conditions. With the measurement of mood prior and after the writing task we checked changes in your emotional state. After that,
	  we observed your risk-taking behavior in the small gambling game. The other questions only served the purpose to distract you from the real goal of our study to avoid bias. 
	  We hope that this information helps you to realize that you should not further feel sad, angry or fearful and leave the emotional state again. If not, please don't hesitate to
	  talk to someone or contact us.
